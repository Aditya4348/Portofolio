      "This Todo List app was developed as a modern task management solution, focused on performance, usability, and responsive design. Built with Laravel Livewire, it delivers real-time interactivity without the need for additional JavaScript.All core features such as adding, editing, completing, and deleting tasks are handled without page reloads, ensuring a fast and seamless user experience — ideal for individuals or small teams.The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS, resulting in a clean, minimalist interface that looks great on all screen sizes. Responsiveness and speed were key priorities throughout the development.This project also serves as an exploration into building backend-driven SPA-like applications without relying on frontend frameworks like React or Vue. It showcases how Laravel can power interactive, modern web apps on its own.More than just a productivity tool, this app is a demonstration of my ability to build scalable, interactive web applications with clean architecture and modern tech stacks.",
